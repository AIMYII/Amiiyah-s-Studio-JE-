# Amiiyah's Studio [JE]
A data and resource pack that allows modders' to animate anything, with our example animations.

**The resource and data packs are compatible with Minecraft 1.21.1**

An optional mod will be available for custom entities, attributes, or abilities. The mod is designed for Forge 1.21.1 and up, but is **not required** â€” the data and resource packs work in vanilla Minecraft.

Tutorial:

Tools:
- https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/tree/main/resource_pack/animations - the animation folder, since it has the files that we can change.
- MCreator: https://mcreator.net/. Optional, but for making the RP and DPs.
- Blockbench: https://www.blockbench.net/, for making the custom player animations.
  - Add-ons for Blockbench, [CEM ](https://ewanhowell.com/plugins/cem-template-loader) by Ewan Howell.
  - And the custom made player models in the files.
